#### Actions to choose from:

* $T$: Treat
* $W$: Wait ("Watchful Waiting")

#### Bayes expected loss for action $A$ = $\rho$ = $\rho (A|X) = {E_{\theta |X}}(Loss(\theta, A))$.

* $\rho (T|X) = Loss(Healthy, Treat) \times Pr(Healthy | X)$

* $\rho (W|X) = Loss(Sick, Wait) \times Pr(Sick | X)$


### Best decisions  (Bayes rule):

* Where the $W$ line is below the $T$ line, the better decision is $W$.
* Where the $T$ line is below the $W$ line, the better decision is $T$.
* Where (if) the $W$ and $T$ lines cross, the two decisions are equivalent, because they have the same Bayes expected loss.


* "__Horizontal axis Parameter__":  the parameter along the horizontal axis.
The vertical blue line occurs at the chosen value. 

* "__Observation__":  Either $P$ for positive test, or $N$ for negative test. Bayes expected loss for the two actions $T$ and $W$ is conditional on the observation.
