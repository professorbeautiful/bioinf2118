```{r}
Table1_data = matrix(
  dimnames = list(
    theta=c('healthy', 'sick'),
    X=c('negative',	'positive',	'indeterminate')
    ),
  c(
    0.95,	0.03,	0.02,
    0.03,	0.95,	0.02),
  nrow=2, byrow=TRUE
)
print(Table1_data)
```

QUESTION 1:  Which variable, X or theta, are the table entries conditional on?
(Replace NULL with your answer, in this chunk.)

```{r}
Answer1 = NULL
```


```{r}
cat('\nHere are the row sums:\n')
print(rowSums(Table1_data))
print(colSums(Table1_data))

```

QUESTION 2:  Write a function "joint_probability" that takes as its arguments an outcome X  and a state-of-nature, and returns the probability of that outcome.

Example of use: joint_probability("negative", "healthy")

First, we will construct Table 2, the JOINT distribution.

```{r}

```
