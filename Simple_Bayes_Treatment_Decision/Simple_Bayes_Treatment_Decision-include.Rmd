This "shiny app" shows Bayes expected loss for decisions 

* "T": Treat
* "W": Wait



The vertical blue lines occur at the default values.

* Where the W line is below the T line, the better decision is `W`.
* Where the T line is below the W line, the better decision is `T`.
* Where (if) the W and T lines cross, the two decisions are equivalent, because they have the same Bayes expected loss:

Bayes expected loss = $\rho$ = $\rho (a|X) = {E_{\theta |X}}(L(\theta ,a))$.

INTERACTIVE CONTROLS:

* "Parameter to vary":  the parameter along the horizontal axis.
* "Observation":  Either P for positive test, or N for negative test. Results are conditional on the observation.
